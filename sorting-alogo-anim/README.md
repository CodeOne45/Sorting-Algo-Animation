    Sorting Visualizer
</h1>

---

## This repo is an attempt to help in learning popular sorting algorithms by visualization

Helps to

- understand the working of sorting algorithm
- check total swaps required
- check total comparisions
- compare algorithms side by side
- know the time taken (time is just an approximate unit for comparision)
